title: Welcome to the Journey
---
Research is one of the main drivers of evolution and is crucial for validating real-life observations. Like many others, I work as a researcher at a university, aiming to shed light on topics such as Cloud Native, DevOps, and Microservice-based applications.

This page is intended to serve as both a source of motivation and a documentation of my journey toward earning a PhD. Unlike a 100-meter sprint, where the finish line is in clear view, this journey is more akin to a marathon, where endurance and perseverance are key.

I hope this page reflects steady progress on my dissertation journey.
